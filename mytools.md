# My Tools

I got this idea from [Steve Smith](https://ardalis.com/tools-used/). It's a list of tools that I use and recommend.

## Editors & Terminals

- Code: Visual Studio Code ([my settings](https://github.com/wahidsaleemi/vscode))
- Markdown: Typora
- Terminal: Windows Terminal ([my profile](https://github.com/wahidsaleemi/winterminalprofile))

## Source Control

GitHub and Azure Repos, depending on what my customers are using.

## VS Code Extensions

I'm using Settings Sync so I have a consistent experience regardless of which computer I'm using. Here are the extensions:

- .NET Install Tool for Extension Authors by Microsoft
- Code Spell Checker by Street Side Software
- Docs Authoring Pack by Microsoft
- GitLens – Git supercharged by Eric Amodio
- GitGraph – View branches in graph view – by mhutchie
- Jupyter by Microsoft
- markdownlint by David Anson
- PowerShell by Microsoft
- Prettier – Code Formatter by Esben Petersen
- Project Manager
- Python
- Remote - Containers
- Remote - WSL
- Shell launcher
- Live Share (see demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXH1gz8utZA))
- YAML by Red Hat

The following are useful for Azure:

- ARM Template Viewer by Ben Coleman
- Azure Account by Microsoft
- Azure Log Analytics Syntax Highlighting by Josef Sin
- Azure Pipelines by Microsoft

## PowerShell Modules

I try to stay on the latest PowerShell 7. Here is my [profile](https://github.com/wahidsaleemi/pwshprofile) and have the following modules installed (besides default ones):

| Module        |      |      |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- |
| ARMHelper     |      |      |
| Az            |      |      |
| AzureAD       |      |      |
| PSReadLine    |      |      |
| oh-my-posh    |      |      |
| posh-git      |      |      |
| PowerShellGet |      |      |
| Pester        |      |      |
| ThreadJob     |      |      |

## Extending Git

- [git-branchless](https://github.com/arxanas/git-branchless/wiki/Installation): Gives you 'git undo' and 'git sl' (shows graph of commits) in your command-line.
