I'm Wahid and I don't consider myself a developer but since infrastructure is code now, I guess I need to learn som things. I architect awesome cloud solutions at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com)

- ðŸŒ± I blog (infrequently) on my [Cloud Collaboration blog](http://www.wahidsaleemi.com).
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Azure infrastructure and ARM templates; I dabble in home automation and finance too.
- ðŸ’° See my certifications on [Acclaim](https://www.youracclaim.com/users/wahid-saleemi).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hacked a public institution when I was 14. They called me to come in and see their IT director. It was either to give me a job or arrest me; I didn't show up.

## My tools

Check out [my tools list](mytools.md) to learn about what I use for development.
